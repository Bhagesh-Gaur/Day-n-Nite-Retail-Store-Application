## About the project
This project aims to create a database storing all the necessary details for a retail store system, to allow incorporation of data and features seen in larger retail store chains such as Big Bazaar, Blink It and JioMart.

Such retail store systems consist of multiple stores or branches across the country, and each branch receives their products from various suppliers. Storing multiple attributes of products is important for the management of the store structure, finances, and communication of the store with all external stakeholders including customers. Furthermore, storing information about various customers and their purchases allows making the purchases and transactions easier, and allows many more features to the customers, such as availing discounts.

Stores such as Blink It, JioMart have also allowed purchasing items online, further increasing its consumer base.
An online interface further allows features such as home delivery, writing reviews, and asking questions.

Developed full-stack retail store management website was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node Js, Express Js, Pug and MySQL. Application has extensive functionalities including wishlist, cart, product based Q&amp;A, delivery track, etc and the database was designed with core DBMS concepts in mind.
